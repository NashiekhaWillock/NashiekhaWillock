## üìö What I'm Working on
ü§ñ Trading Bot Project

üìà Description: As a junior software developer, I'm actively engaged in developing a trading bot project utilizing Flask and Python for the backend, and React with Tailwind CSS for the frontend. In addition to implementing core trading functionalities, I've integrated web scraping mechanisms to fetch real-time news headlines from leading financial websites, including Yahoo Finance and Financial Times.

üîß Tech Stack:
Backend Development: Utilizing Flask to create RESTful APIs for seamless communication between frontend and backend components. Implementing web scraping scripts with BeautifulSoup to extract news headlines from external sources.
Frontend Development: Leveraging React with Tailwind CSS to design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for monitoring market trends and managing trading activities.
Integration: Integrating external data sources, such as Yahoo Finance and Financial Times, to provide users with up-to-date news articles and insights relevant to their investment decisions.
Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions and provide informative responses in case of data retrieval failures.

üì∞ News Integration:
Yahoo Finance: Scraping news headlines from Yahoo Finance to provide users with insights into the latest market trends, company announcements, and economic developments.
Financial Times: Extracting news articles from the Financial Times to offer comprehensive coverage of global financial markets, business news, and analysis.

üîç Next Steps:
Continuously refining the trading bot project to enhance its functionality, performance, and user experience. Exploring advanced techniques in web scraping, data analysis, and natural language processing to extract deeper insights from news articles and improve trading strategies.
