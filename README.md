# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am Nashiekha!
Junior Software Engineer | Passionate about programming and developing my coding knowledge.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm thrilled to have you here. I am a motivated junior software engineer with a computer science degree. My passion lies in front-end development, where I enjoy crafting beautiful and user-friendly interfaces. However, I'm also eager to expand my skills and delve into the exciting world of full-stack development.

Throughout my academic journey and personal projects, I've gained hands-on experience with various technologies and programming languages. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have worked with frameworks like React. I'm also familiar with back-end technologies such as Node.js and databases like MongoDB.

I have an insatiable appetite for learning and staying abreast of the latest industry trends. I am committed to continuous improvement, constantly seeking out new tools and techniques to elevate my coding prowess.
